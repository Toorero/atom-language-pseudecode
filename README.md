# Pascal language support in Atom

Add support to **Pascal** language in **Atom**.

_Originally [converted](http://atom.io/docs/latest/converting-a-text-mate-bundle)
from the [Pascal TextMate bundle](https://github.com/textmate/pascal.tmbundle)._

### What is it?

You get:

* Syntax Highlighting
* Snippets

### Compatibility

The plugin is primarily compatible to **Delphi** variant of **Pascal**, but **FreePascal/Lazarus** support is getting better.

### Participate

Contributions are greatly appreciated. Please fork this repository and open a pull request to add snippets, make grammar tweaks, etc.
